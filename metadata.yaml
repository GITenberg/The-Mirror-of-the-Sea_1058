description: The Mirror of the Sea is Joseph Conrad's true-life account of his seventeen-year
  odyssey at sea, told through a series of essays. Portraying the ocean as a metaphor
  against which men could measure themselves, Conrad hints at the themes of his later
  fictional works. First published in 1906.
